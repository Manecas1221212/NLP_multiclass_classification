# NLP_multiclass_classification
This is a Multi Class Classification of medical papers text using deep learning and Transformers

This was my milestone project for a course. The data is comprised of medical pappers and the goal is to be able to classify parts of the papers as abstract, corpus, conclusion etc.
In this notebook I explore RNN arquitectures with TF and a Transformer aquitecture with Pytorch (not using timm though).
This was a very interesting project and I can't wait for my next NLP challenge.
